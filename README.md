Tone Picker Text Tool
A React-based web application that allows users to adjust the tone of their text using AI-powered conversions. Users can transform text between different tones (formal, casual, friendly, professional) through an intuitive 3√ó3 matrix interface.

üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
Frontend Decisions
I chose React with Vite for:

Fast development experience with hot module replacement

Excellent React support and ecosystem

Smaller bundle size compared to Create React App

Modern tooling with minimal configuration

State Management
Implemented a custom hook (useTextHistory) because:

State management needs were relatively simple

Kept the component tree clean without prop drilling

Provided a focused solution for text history management

Made undo/redo functionality self-contained and reusable

Backend Architecture
The backend uses Express.js with:

ES Modules for modern JavaScript support

Middleware-based architecture for separation of concerns

Environment-based configuration for security

Caching layer to reduce API calls

Trade-offs Made
Caching: Used in-memory caching instead of Redis for simplicity

Error Handling: Implemented comprehensive but simple error handling

State Persistence: Chose session-based persistence rather than database storage

UI Framework: Used pure CSS instead of a UI framework to keep bundle size small

üîÑ State Management: Undo/Redo Functionality
Implementation Details
The undo/redo functionality uses a custom React hook useTextHistory that manages:

javascript
const [history, setHistory] = useState([initialText]); // Array of text states
const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0); // Pointer to current state
How It Works
Initialization: Starts with initial text state and index 0

Adding to History: When text changes:

javascript
const addToHistory = (newText) => {
const newHistory = history.slice(0, currentIndex + 1);
newHistory.push(newText);
setHistory(newHistory);
setCurrentIndex(newHistory.length - 1);
};
Undo Operation: Moves back through history states

Redo Operation: Moves forward through history states

Benefits
Linear Time Complexity: All operations are efficient

Memory Efficiency: Only stores text changes

Predictable Behavior: Matches user expectations

Self-Contained: Reusable across components

üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Edge Cases
Comprehensive Error Strategy
API Error Handling:

Network timeouts

API rate limiting (429 errors)

Authentication failures (401 errors)

Server errors (5xx responses)

User Input Validation:

Empty text validation

Invalid tone selection handling

Maximum text length considerations

UI Feedback System:

Loading states during API requests

Error messages with user-friendly explanations

Success feedback for completed operations

Specific Edge Cases Handled
Empty Text Submission:

javascript
if (!currentText.trim()) {
setError('Please enter some text first');
return;
}
Network Connectivity Issues:

javascript
if (error.code === 'NETWORK_ERROR') {
setError('Network error. Please check your connection.');
}
API Rate Limiting:

javascript
if (error.response?.status === 429) {
setError('Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in a moment.');
}
Concurrent Requests Prevention: Disable UI during processing

Browser Compatibility: CSS feature detection with fallbacks

Cache Management: Time-based expiration and invalidation

Error Recovery
Retry Mechanism: Users can retry failed operations

State Preservation: Text content is preserved during errors

Graceful Degradation: Application remains usable when API is unavailable

Mock Mode: Falls back to simulated responses when API key is invalid
